"""Model package
================

This package defines the SQLAlchemy models used by the application.
Importing this package will import all individual model modules so
that they can be referenced via ``models.Admin``, ``models.User``, etc.

The models rely on the shared ``db`` instance defined in
``license_server.extensions``.
